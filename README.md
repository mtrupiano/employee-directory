# Employee Tracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This is an application developed to practice using React. The site fetches a list of 'employees' (randomized user data) and renders them as React elements. Clicking on a table header will sort the list of employees by that column.

## Usage
A deployed build of this application can be found [here]().

In order to build the application locally, clone the source repository and run `yarn install` to install dependencies. From the repository's local directory, run `yarn start` in order to run the application. A browser window should then open with the application running.
